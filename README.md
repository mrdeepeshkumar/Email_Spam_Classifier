# Machine Learning
# Email_Spam_Classifier 
## Installation
### Install the requirements 
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have tool to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook.](http://ipython.org/index.html)
Make sure you use Python 3.If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Intalling Anaconda Python
The easiest way to install Jupyter Notebook as well as NumPy, Pandas,matplotlib is to start with the Anaconda Python distribution.
Follow the installation instructions to download the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python. We recommend using Python 3.7.

git clone https://github.com/mrdeepeshkumar/Email_Spam_Classifier Use cd to navigate into the top directory of the repo on your machine

Launch Jupyter by entering

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser. 
## Download the data 
Before running the notebook, you'll first need to download all data we'll be using.The data set is taken from the UCI repository. You can access the data set https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase.

### Features

Most features in the dataset represent count of certain words, denoted by names such as word_frequency_meeting, word_frequency_free etc. Some other features represent features typical of spam emails, such as the maximum length of 'all uppercase words' ('FREE OFFER'), the frequency of non-alphanumeric characters ('!!!!') etc.


### Starting the project:
`Email_Spam_Classifier`repository contains the all necessary project files. To run this project , you may download the all files.The implimented code is provided in the `https://github.com/mrdeepeshkumar/Email_Spam_Classifier` jupyter notebook file.

### Run
To successfully run the project In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Email_Spam_Classifier/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
     
    ipython notebook Linear+SVM+-+Email+Spam+Classifier_without_using_Kernal.ipynb
  or
    
    jupyter notebook Linear+SVM+-+Email+Spam+Classifier_without_using_Kernal.ipynb
    
### Methodology:
#### Understanding the data: 
#### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
#### Model Building:
Built a SVM classifier to classify emails and compare the performance with the linear SVM model.
#### Evaluation:
  The implementation was done by deploying the SVM algorithm with an accuracy of 93%.
